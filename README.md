## What is it?

Here's what we wrote in our [hackathon entry](hackathon-entry.md):

Ventrue is a pitching platform for students, and a backing platform for supporters — who can be schools, humanitarian organizations, or anyone looking to champion the next generation of developers, designers, and disruptors.

## How did the hackathon go?

Well, it was in a less than workable state.... In fact, if you'd like to travel back in time, you can check out exactly what it looked like by the end of the hackathon [here](https://ventrue-6uakd9xca-compsigh.vercel.app). Nonetheless, we learned a lot about Next.js and so since then we've committed to maintaining it as a demo project for teaching/group practice purposes.
